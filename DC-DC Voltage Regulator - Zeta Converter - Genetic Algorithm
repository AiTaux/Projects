DC-DC Voltage Regulator Based on Zeta Converter for Photovoltaic Application System Genetic Algorithm (GA) Optimized PID Controller

https://youtu.be/gpfgbq7rBdY

Design a zeta converter with varying input voltage and constant output voltage for PV application.
Develop a genetic algorithm (GA) optimized PID controller for the zeta converter.
Analyze the performance of the zeta converter in terms of the output voltage ripples and peak overshoot during the transient condition.
